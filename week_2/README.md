# Week 2: Arrays
This folder contains the assignments for Week 1 of the Harvard CS50x class, created independently. These have not been tested against the CS50 style or correctness. They also do not use the CS50 C libraries.

For copyright purposes, this repository will contain only the C code I have written. Please go to [The CS50 website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/1) to view the requirements and outcomes for the assignments.
