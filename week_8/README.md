# Week 8: HTML, CSS, Javascript
A collection of Web site practice problems. 
To test these: 

1. Download the folder ('homepage' or 'trivia')
2. `cd` into the folder
3. Run `python -m http.server`

Python comes standard with a small http server and will index and present all files in the folder. 

Make sure Python is installed on your system!

## Trivia
This is a practice problem (the code is provided) to familiarize the student with some basic functionality and structure.

## Homepage
A collection of at least five html pages, one CSS, and including at least 10 distinct html tags.
For my project, I have created an online book reader of sorts. The Home page is a voting system to vote on 3 books.
The other three pages present the top 3 books from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org) in a format designed to reduce eye strain.
See specification.txt for the requirements for the class.
