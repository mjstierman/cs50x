# Harvard CS50x

[Harvard CS50x 2025](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025)

The purpose of this repository is to perform all of the same puzzles and exercises assigned in the Harvard CS50X Introduction to Computer Science course.

The intent is not to write the *best* code, but to scale the quality of code with the class' topics. If the class doesn't teach tuples until week 2, I won't use them in week 1's exercises. Week 5's excercises would use all concepts taught in the class so far.

- Week 0 Scratch
- Week 1 C
- Week 2 Arrays
- Week 3 Algorithms
- Week 4 Memory
- Week 5 Data Structures
- Week 6 Python
- Week 7 SQL
- Week 8 HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Week 9 Flask
- Week 10 The End
